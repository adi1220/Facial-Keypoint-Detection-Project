# Facial-Keypoint-Detection-Project
This is my first computer vision project.
In this project, i had combined my knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures to build a facial keypoint detection system that takes in any image with faces, and predicts the location of 68 distinguishing keypoints on each face!

Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. These applications include: facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition. 
## Description 
The project will be broken up into a few main parts in four Python notebooks :<br/>
[Notebook 1](https://github.com/aditya1267/Facial-Keypoint-Detection-Project/blob/master/1.%20Load%20and%20Visualize%20Data.ipynb)
Loading and Visualizing the Facial Keypoint Data. <br/>
[Notebook 2](https://github.com/aditya1267/Facial-Keypoint-Detection-Project/blob/master/2.%20Define%20the%20Network%20Architecture.ipynb)
Defining and Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to Predict Facial Keypoints.<br/>
[Notebook 3](https://github.com/aditya1267/Facial-Keypoint-Detection-Project/blob/master/3.%20Facial%20Keypoint%20Detection%2C%20Complete%20Pipeline.ipynb)
